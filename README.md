# MonthTemperatures

This is a Java program that stores data in the form of monthly temperatures for a year. The month and temperature are stored in two different arrays. The program prompts the user for the month to be viewed and displays both the month and average temperature. If "year" is entered, the output program provides the temperature for each month along with the yearly average as well as the highest and lowest monthly averages.
